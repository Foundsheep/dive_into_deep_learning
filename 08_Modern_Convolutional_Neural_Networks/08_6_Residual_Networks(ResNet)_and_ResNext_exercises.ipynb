    "- In general, `Inception block` is more complicated than `Residual block`, because it has a few more paths where input is consumed in different ways, and how the input is merged with $f(x)$ is different. `Inception block` takes concatenation, whereas `Residual block` adds the input element-wise."

    "- In terms of computation, if we assume `Inception block`'s `3 X 3 conv` is the same as the counterpart of `Residual block`, the former one has 6 more convolutional layers in one block, so `Inception block` is more computationally expensive. And this conclusion is also based on the assumption that element-wise adding and concatenation are pretty much the same in computational efficiency"
